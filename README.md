# Jam Launch Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use the Jam Launch addon to make a multiplayer
game in Godot 4. Integration with the Jam Launch addon allows games to be
deployed and hosted in the Jam Launch cloud.

You can sign up for an account [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/?signUp=1).

## Try out a deployed version

With a regular Jam Launch account, you can play an already deployed version of
the example project [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/g/FP8XMOFFKp/x12).

The current hosting servers are in eastern North America, so you may encounter
high latency in other regions. More hosting regions will be coming online in
early 2024.

## Deploy with a Jam Launch Developer account

If you have a Jam Launch developer account, you can deploy and test your own
version of the project with one click from the addon's editor plugin:

## Test locally

If you don't have a developer account yet, you can still run the example (or
your own game) in local hosting mode with the addon.
