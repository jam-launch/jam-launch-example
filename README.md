# Jam Launch Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use the Jam Launch addon to make a multiplayer
game in Godot 4. The Jam Launch addon simplifies deployment and hosting of
multiplayer games.

Most features are only available with a Jam Launch account. You can sign up for
an account [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/?signUp=1).

## Try out a deployed version

With a regular Jam Launch account, you can play a deployed version of
the example project [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/g/e61CshPH-0K).

## Deploy with a Jam Launch Credits

Jam Launch credits can be purchased and used to host your project on Jam Launch infrastructure. You only pay for the resources you use, and deployments can be
done in one click from the addon's editor plugin:

## Test locally

If you don't want to buy credits, you can still run games in local hosting mode
with the addon. This allows you to verify game functionality and compatibility
with Jam Launch.
