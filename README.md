# Jam Launch Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use the Jam Launch addon to make a multiplayer
game in Godot 4. The Jam Launch addon simplifies deployment and hosting of
multiplayer games.

Most features are only available with a Jam Launch account. You can sign up for
an account [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/?signUp=1).

## Try out a deployed version

With a regular Jam Launch account, you can play a deployed version of
the example project [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/g/FP8XMOFFKp/x17).

The current hosting servers are in eastern North America, and western Europe,
so you may encounter high latency in other regions. More hosting regions will
be coming online in early 2024.


## Deploy with a Jam Launch Developer account

With a Jam Launch developer account, you can deploy and test any addon-enabled
project (including this one) with one click from the addon's editor plugin:

## Test locally

If you don't have a developer account yet, you can still run games in local
hosting mode with the addon. This allows you to verify game functionality and
compatibility with Jam Launch.
